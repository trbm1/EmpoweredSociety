                            Open source software is a game-changer for maintaining control over your technical solutions. 
                            By providing complete access to the source code, it allows you to modify and customize the software to perfectly fit your needs.

                            The Universal Web is a (Decentralized Autonomous Cloud) community-driven innovation, where individuals play a pivotal role in shaping a decentralized ecosystem. Here, people have the opportunity to contribute their computing, storage, or transmission abilities to the network, fostering a collaborative environment that thrives on diversity and inclusivity. Through a consensus protocol, contributions are rewarded, ensuring fairness and transparency. This approach not only makes the network elastic and adaptable to varying demands but also economically viable and environmentally friendly. The Universal Web celebrates the power of collective action and the transformative potential of decentralized technologies to create a more sustainable and equitable future.

                            The Universal Web is designed to serve as a foundational building block for both smaller and larger communities within society. With a focus on interconnectedness, it aims to foster collaboration and cohesion, empowering communities to thrive at every scale.

                    Rebuilding the internet takes quite some systems to orchestrate together. Most people in the market don't have 20+ Years experience
                    to know where to start, what to do, and keep in mind. It takes experience to achieve best-in-class. With our content subscription 
                    you get access to our articles, organized by our UTA model, to start building your DAC as a Professional.
