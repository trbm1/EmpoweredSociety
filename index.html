                <p class="major">Nations around the world are becoming increasingly reliant on the "Silicon Six," whose influence has been shown to negatively affect the well-being of their citizens.</p>
                <p class="major">
                    Big tech algorithms have significantly impacted society by amplifying biases, spreading misinformation, and prioritizing profit over well-being. These algorithms, designed to maximize engagement, often promote sensational content, fostering divisiveness and echo chambers that polarize opinions. Additionally, they exploit personal data to create addictive experiences, leading to issues like reduced privacy, mental health concerns, and manipulation of public opinion. The lack of transparency and accountability in how these algorithms operate has raised ethical concerns, as they often deepen inequality by reinforcing existing biases in areas such as hiring, policing, and social services.

                <p class="major">
                    Nations are losing control over digital influence, as foreign platforms and interests dominate the flow of information. The current Internet model is unsustainable, strained by rising regulations, climate disasters, online fraud, political shifts, and increasing censorship. This dependence on external, often foreign, entities makes digital infrastructure more expensive and vulnerable, threatening both the availability of information and the autonomy of communities.

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p class="major">
                    Free services offered by big tech companies have driven down the cost of business services, making them the most affordable and often the only viable option for many. By offering tools like cloud storage, email, and collaboration platforms for free or at low prices, these companies have set a standard that smaller competitors can’t match, forcing businesses to rely on these giants. 
                </p>
                <p class="major">
                    This has not only stifled competition and reduced market diversity but has also led to massive job losses related to or in the tech and telecommunications sectors, as traditional providers struggle to maintain revenue. With big tech monopolizing the space, companies that once thrived on offering infrastructure services are losing ground. Meanwhile, workers in these industries face redundancies as automation and cloud-based services replace human roles, further contributing to economic imbalance. This dependency on big tech comes at the cost of data privacy and long-term flexibility, reinforcing a system where power and profit are concentrated in a few hands.

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p class="major">
                    To gain the same pricing advantage as big tech, a decentralized, interconnected network could reverse the traditional profit model by rewarding participants with cryptocurrency for providing transport, storage, and computation capabilities. Instead of keeping citizens dependent on public cloud services, this model would create a more equitable system where "free internet services" are earned through active participation in the network. By decentralizing the infrastructure and incentivizing contributors, the network can lower costs while maintaining efficiency and resilience, providing an alternative to the monopoly of big tech and fostering user-driven ownership of digital resources.

                            To guarantee secure communication between phones, tablets, desktops, or servers in the network, identity should be integrated at the lowest level possible. 
                            Using cryptographic techniques during the installation of the device, the identity is embedded, allowing access through the network protocol based on this identity. 
                            This practice ensures that device-to-device communication is identity-based and encrypted, applied at the transport layer (OSI level 4). 
                            This method prevents compromised network communication even if a device is compromised, as all communication between devices is identity-based.

                        <p>
                            Using the three base components of Satellite (Backbone), Service Nodes, and Distribution Nodes, a complete 
                            network can be built, scalable from small to large deployments. These components form the backbone of a robust 
                            and versatile publishing infrastructure. The Satellite (Backbone) serves as the central hub, providing primary 
                            connectivity and routing, while Service Nodes act as intermediaries that can conceal complex networks. 
                            Distribution Nodes, accessed either through load balancers or directly via Wi-Fi, serve as the endpoints, ensuring 
                            that services are effectively delivered to the end-users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By employing a specialized protocol, these types of nodes are automatically configured and integrated into the network 
                            they are intended to serve. This protocol ensures seamless connectivity and efficient communication among all components, 
                            regardless of the network's scale. Each participant in the network can function as a potential failover component, enhancing 
                            redundancy and reliability. This decentralized approach allows the network to grow organically, adapting to increasing demands 
                            and complexities without the need for extensive manual configuration.

                        <p>
                            In the network protocol, Proof of Transport, Stake/Store, and Computation/Work are pivotal mechanisms that 
                            dynamically reward contributing members. Proof of Transport ensures that nodes actively participating in data 
                            transfer are recognized and rewarded, validating their contribution to network connectivity and stability. 
                            Stake/Store incentivizes nodes to allocate their storage resources, creating a distributed data repository that 
                            enhances network reliability. By staking their resources, nodes earn rewards based on the amount and duration of 
                            their contribution, promoting a stable and robust network infrastructure. Computation/Work recognizes nodes providing 
                            computational power, ensuring that processing tasks are distributed and managed efficiently across the network.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Fairness and transparency are core principles embedded in these mechanisms. The network protocol employs a decentralized 
                            ledger to record and verify contributions, ensuring that all actions are transparent and verifiable by any network participant. 
                            Rewards are calculated based on predefined algorithms that objectively measure the value of each contribution, whether it's 
                            transport, storage, or computation. This approach guarantees that all members are fairly compensated for their efforts, 
                            fostering trust and encouraging ongoing participation. By transparently managing contributions and rewards, the network 
                            maintains its integrity and promotes equitable resource distribution.

                        <p>
                            Network Elasticity is a key feature of this system, where individuals contributing their computing, transport, and 
                            storage resources are incentivized for facilitating their capacity. The network dynamically adjusts to varying demands, 
                            utilizing between 0% to 100% of a node's capacity based on current needs. This flexibility ensures optimal performance and 
                            resource utilization, allowing the network to scale efficiently. Node owners can throttle their contributions as needed, 
                            providing the necessary resources for their own tasks while still supporting the network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For instance, during the day, a node owner might throttle 40% of their capacity, retaining 60% for personal use. At night, the 
                            situation might reverse, with the node contributing up to 90% of its capacity to the network. This dynamic adjustment ensures 
                            that the network can leverage available resources effectively, while still respecting the needs of individual contributors. 
                            By incentivizing participation, the system encourages a robust and resilient infrastructure, capable of scaling and adapting 
                            to meet varying demands.

                            provide multiple options for finding redundant components without any complex configuration. 
                            Due to the decentralized nature of this network, every participant becomes a potential failover component.

                            In the event of a major service failure, a grid of phones in the vicinity automatically forms a network, 
                            replacing the failed network components with this grid of phones.

                            A general decentralized Cloud Storage network for the Universal Web is scalable with Service and Distribution nodes fulfilling 
                            roles such as redundancy. This network is capable of storing general content, maintaining the ledgers of the network, and housing 
                            Large Language Models (LLMs). Integrated identity and cryptographic techniques ensure secure communication and storage, providing robust 
                            protection against compromised devices. This decentralized approach ensures that all stored data and communication remain secure and accessible across the network.

                            The Universal Web enables every governed community to utilize its own Coin to incentivize and tax network and economic activity. This system supports a 
                            hierarchical chain structure, allowing authority to be delegated to various societal areas. A master ledger at the community level, along with sibling chains, 
                            automatically orchestrates as one cohesive network of chains. Simply connect a community treasury to activate and bring the network to life.
