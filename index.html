                            To guarantee secure communication between phones, tablets, desktops, or servers in the network, identity should be integrated at the lowest level possible. 
                            Using cryptographic techniques during the installation of the device, the identity is embedded, allowing access through the network protocol based on this identity. 
                            This practice ensures that device-to-device communication is identity-based and encrypted, applied at the transport layer (OSI level 4). 
                            This method prevents compromised network communication even if a device is compromised, as all communication between devices is identity-based.

                        <p>
                            Using the three base components of Satellite (Backbone), Service Nodes, and Distribution Nodes, a complete 
                            network can be built, scalable from small to large deployments. These components form the backbone of a robust 
                            and versatile publishing infrastructure. The Satellite (Backbone) serves as the central hub, providing primary 
                            connectivity and routing, while Service Nodes act as intermediaries that can conceal complex networks. 
                            Distribution Nodes, accessed either through load balancers or directly via Wi-Fi, serve as the endpoints, ensuring 
                            that services are effectively delivered to the end-users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By employing a specialized protocol, these types of nodes are automatically configured and integrated into the network 
                            they are intended to serve. This protocol ensures seamless connectivity and efficient communication among all components, 
                            regardless of the network's scale. Each participant in the network can function as a potential failover component, enhancing 
                            redundancy and reliability. This decentralized approach allows the network to grow organically, adapting to increasing demands 
                            and complexities without the need for extensive manual configuration.

                        <p>
                            In the network protocol, Proof of Transport, Stake/Store, and Computation/Work are pivotal mechanisms that 
                            dynamically reward contributing members. Proof of Transport ensures that nodes actively participating in data 
                            transfer are recognized and rewarded, validating their contribution to network connectivity and stability. 
                            Stake/Store incentivizes nodes to allocate their storage resources, creating a distributed data repository that 
                            enhances network reliability. By staking their resources, nodes earn rewards based on the amount and duration of 
                            their contribution, promoting a stable and robust network infrastructure. Computation/Work recognizes nodes providing 
                            computational power, ensuring that processing tasks are distributed and managed efficiently across the network.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Fairness and transparency are core principles embedded in these mechanisms. The network protocol employs a decentralized 
                            ledger to record and verify contributions, ensuring that all actions are transparent and verifiable by any network participant. 
                            Rewards are calculated based on predefined algorithms that objectively measure the value of each contribution, whether it's 
                            transport, storage, or computation. This approach guarantees that all members are fairly compensated for their efforts, 
                            fostering trust and encouraging ongoing participation. By transparently managing contributions and rewards, the network 
                            maintains its integrity and promotes equitable resource distribution.

                        <p>
                            Network Elasticity is a key feature of this system, where individuals contributing their computing, transport, and 
                            storage resources are incentivized for facilitating their capacity. The network dynamically adjusts to varying demands, 
                            utilizing between 0% to 100% of a node's capacity based on current needs. This flexibility ensures optimal performance and 
                            resource utilization, allowing the network to scale efficiently. Node owners can throttle their contributions as needed, 
                            providing the necessary resources for their own tasks while still supporting the network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For instance, during the day, a node owner might throttle 40% of their capacity, retaining 60% for personal use. At night, the 
                            situation might reverse, with the node contributing up to 90% of its capacity to the network. This dynamic adjustment ensures 
                            that the network can leverage available resources effectively, while still respecting the needs of individual contributors. 
                            By incentivizing participation, the system encourages a robust and resilient infrastructure, capable of scaling and adapting 
                            to meet varying demands.

                            In the event of a general outage or disaster, failover is built into the network protocol to 
                            provide multiple options for finding redundant components without any complex configuration. 
                            Due to the decentralized nature of this network, every participant becomes a potential failover component.

                            With the OnLive project definition (active run in the ESP Lab), disaster recovery is managed by 
                            collective participants with mobile phones who are within range or near service or distribution nodes. 
                            In the event of a major service failure, a grid of phones in the vicinity automatically forms a network, 
                            replacing the failed network components with this grid of phones.

                            Crypto has been around for over a decade, proving its qualities and weaknesses. It has become evident that linking multiple crypto chains together 
                            provides scalability, separation of transaction types, and optimization of parameters. The concepts of On-Chain, ZK-Rollup, and Off-Chain transactions 
                            have become fundamental to cross-chaining, enabling secure and fast collaboration between hierarchical authorities.

                            Within the design of the 'Universal Web' reference implementation, every defined authority in a hierarchical structure (delegation) inherits automatic 
                            pre-configured rollup mechanisms. This setup facilitates not only authority delegation but also financial transactions. With this inherited structure, 
                            comprehensive treasury management is achieved.

                <p>
                    Four primary captains oversee the twelve areas of interest. Founder Hans van den Akker, a technologist 
                    with 21 years of diverse experience, has been preparing this project for 3 years and 7 months. 
                    He describes it as 'the arc of Noah' for our culture and beliefs. Hans is dedicated to ensuring 
                    that all objectives are achieved.

                <p>
                    To implement the UTA at the state level, we envision the best opportunities by spreading our activities across 
                    three distinct countries: Oman, Thailand, and Bhutan. Our strongest connections, who share our objectives and 
                    passion for this project, have been identified but are not yet fully onboarded. As a result, the situation may change.

                <p>
                    Rebuilding the internet takes quite some systems to orchestrate together. Most people in the market don't have 20+ Years experience
                    to know where to start, what to do, and keep in mind. It takes experience to achieve best-in-class. With our content subscription 
                    you get access to our articles, organized by our UTA model, to start building your DAC as a Professional.

                <p>
                    Would you like to see your DAC (sub)project brought to life in the real world? So would we! 
                    To help us develop specific cases within the DAC space, we're building a network of experts and partners. 
                    You can sponsor us to be a part of this journey—it's like crowd-funding, but for a select group of people.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are generally open to funding from multiple investors, but we limit the number of stakeholders to no more than 12. 
                    Stakeholders can invest in multiple portions, gaining a greater degree of influence on the development of the project. 
                    Our guiding principle is 'Inshalah' meaning we do not intend to predetermine the distribution of investments or the influencing parties. 
                    However, we require that all stakeholders carry a moral compass for the future of humanity on our beloved Mother Earth.
