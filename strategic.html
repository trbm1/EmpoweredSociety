                <p class="major">                    
                    Our primary focus will be on the East, specifically the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) and APAC (Asia-Pacific) regions, for establishing partnerships for the UTA and its work 
                    towards the Universal Web, is rooted in cultural and religious values that are more closely aligned with human morality. The diverse spiritual and ethical frameworks in 
                    these regions, including Hinduism, Bahá'í Faith, Buddhism, Islam (including the Quran's teachings), and others, emphasize community, integrity, and respect for the 
                    collective well-being. These values resonate with the foundational principles of the Universal Web, which aim to create a secure, inclusive, and morally grounded digital environment.
                </p>

                <p class="major">
                    In contrast, our engagement with regions in the West, such as AMER (Americas) and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), is considered a secondary extension. 
                    Any significant expansion into these areas will depend on a majority vote from our Eastern partners, as we prioritize cultural alignment and shared values in our initial stages. 
                    While we do not anticipate immediate expansion into these Western regions, we remain open to future collaborations as our network and shared understanding grow.

                            <p>
                                Open Source Licensing empowers communities by bringing them together and enabling collaborative efforts. A common challenge in this model is 
                                ensuring the sustainability of the community, particularly in terms of funding and rewarding contributions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To address this issue for the 'Universal Web' reference implementation, the UTA will release all sources, code, and generated content under a tailored 
                                Community Source License. This license will grant licensed parties the rights to use and distribute the content within their network.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                UAC subscription members automatically receive a Community Source License, which provides them with all the rights typically granted by an MIT license. The goal is to expand the 
                                community to include a broad base of users of technical systems. The subscription supports the community's development efforts by licensing all sources to its primary beneficiary: Mother Earth.

                            <h3>Patents and Royaltees for Essential Systems of Society</h3>                         
                            <p>
                                Patents usually are monetized by collecting royaltees. However. When it comes to basic rights, this damages society. The UTA lobbies for these kind of 
                                situations. Royalties For Essential Systems => Are Lobbied under 'Basic Human Rights' towards the Essential Systems License Act, supported by the network members.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some systems contribute to a faster, smarter, effective, or more efficient operation of the technology in the universal web. For instance, algorithms that allow 100Gbps 
                                throughput on median device architectures are such an example. The UTA lobbies in these cases for 'better human rights' by addressing patent holders and arranging 
                                specialized licenses, royalty-free, for implementing and operating these patented advances for the sake of human heritage.
                                In a world where sustainability on all levels has become a fashion trend, patent-holding companies have the opportunity to act bravely and give back to humanity. 
                                For this, they are officially recognized and as such, showing repentance for past misconduct.</p>

                            Stories from early history suggest that the leading prophet Noah named the country 'Oman'. While there is no direct translation of what
                            Oman means, if Oman were to lead the charge in building sovereign digital societies in the GCC, it could be seen as an omen of hope, usually the message prophets bring.
                            Interestingly, people have likened the UTA and its objective to building the 'Ark of Noah.'

                            A big project that the UTA is untaking shouldn't be taken lightly. Re-creating the internet in existing communities needs a lot of energy put in to achieve success. Ironically
                            this country is called Bhutan. The second biggest energy source in the world ('gaseous substance'). While not the reason of choosing Bhutan als secondary pilot, we believe
                            this 'energy' and 'happiness' are necessary to succeed as a collective.

                    This is the R&D program, known as Labs, which executes multiple Smartup projects aimed at fostering innovation and 
                    community development. A Smartup is a collective that democratically creates, owns, and governs technology 
                    to advance the development of The Decentralized Autonomous Cloud. Through Labs, these projects receive the
                     necessary resources, guidance, and collaborative environment to thrive, ensuring that each initiative aligns 
                     with the broader mission of sustainable and equitable progress. By integrating cutting-edge research and 
                     development with community-driven objectives, Labs plays a crucial role in driving forward impactful technological solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the perspective of the UAC, each project is meticulously defined and 
                    mapped to ensure effective dependency management. Contributions to the system, whether in creation, 
                    implementation, or testing, are clearly identified and tracked. This holistic approach allows for a 
                    comprehensive understanding of how each project component integrates into the larger system. By outlining 
                    specific roles and responsibilities, the UAC ensures that all contributions are recognized and aligned with 
                    the overarching objectives of the network. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Program management is conducted from the ESP perspective, which orchestrates activities 
                    to achieve product development, delivery, and integration. This involves coordinating various tasks and milestones, 
                    ensuring that dependencies are managed efficiently, and that all elements of the project progress in a synchronized manner. 
                    By leveraging the UAC and ESP frameworks, projects are systematically guided from inception to completion, maintaining 
                    transparency, accountability, and alignment with the network's strategic goals.

                            Based on skills, ambition and reputation you will be able to match with the wide-range of projects involved. The 12 main roles also translate to 'expertise' areas.
                            For each area the uta defines a list of projects where participants are being matched.
